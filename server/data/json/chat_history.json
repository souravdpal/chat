Welcome to my Flask server!\"\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n**Let me explain**... \n- We import the Flask class and create an instance of it.\n- The `@app.route('/')` decorator tells Flask that the `home` function should be triggered when the root URL is accessed.\n- The `home` function returns a simple \"Hello, World!\" message.\n- Finally, we run the Flask app with `app.run(debug=True)`.\n\n**Want to try it out?** \n1. Save this code in a file named `app.py`.\n2. Install Flask using pip: `pip install flask`\n3. Run the server: `python app.py`\n4.
